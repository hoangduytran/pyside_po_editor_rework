# Enhanced File Explorer Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of enhanced navigation and path editing features for the file explorer component in the PySide PO Editor application.

## Core Components

### 1. NavigationHistory

**Purpose:** Manages the browsing history for the file explorer, enabling back/forward navigation.

**Features:**

- Tracks visited directories in a history list
- Maintains current position in history
- Provides methods for back/forward navigation
- Enforces maximum history size

### 2. FileExplorerWidget

**Purpose:** The main UI component for browsing files and directories.

**Enhanced Features:**

#### Path Editing

- Text editor shows current path
- Hover tooltip shows full path and item count information
- Context menu with path operations:
  - Copy Full Path
  - Copy Relative Path
  - Paste Path
  - Paste Environment Variables
- Support for glob pattern filtering
- Path validation with error handling

#### Navigation

- Navigation button with dropdown menu
- History-based navigation (back/forward)
- Standard directory shortcuts:
  - Root (/)
  - Home (~)
  - Parent directory (up)
- History tracking of visited locations

#### View Options

- Toggle hidden files
- View mode selection (list, icons)
- Column customization (size, type, date modified)

### 3. FileExplorerPanel

**Purpose:** Panel container that integrates the explorer widget into the application's docking system.

**Features:**

- Wraps the FileExplorerWidget
- Provides public API for navigation
- Updates window title based on current directory
- Forwards file selection events

## Design Principles

1. **No hasattr() or getattr()** ✅
   - All attributes initialized in `__init__` methods
   - Direct attribute access only

2. **Proper Type Annotations** ✅
   - All methods have appropriate type hints
   - Uses `Optional[str]` for nullable string parameters

3. **Responsive UI Design** ✅
   - Proper signal connections
   - Tooltips and visual feedback
   - Keyboard and mouse navigation

4. **User Experience Improvements** ✅
   - Path editing with environment variable expansion
   - Clipboard integration
   - Visual feedback for navigation
   - File filtering capabilities

## Implementation Details

### Path Editor Features

The path editor has been enhanced with several features:

1. **Path Display**
   - Shows the current directory path
   - On hover, displays full path and item count as tooltip

2. **Context Menu**
   - Right-click menu with path operations
   - Navigation shortcuts
   - View mode toggles

3. **Glob Pattern Filtering**
   - Detects glob patterns in path input
   - Filters displayed files based on pattern
   - Debounced filtering to avoid performance issues

### Navigation Features

The navigation system has been improved with:

1. **History Management**
   - Back/forward navigation
   - History limit to prevent memory issues
   - State tracking for UI updates

2. **Path Navigation**
   - Shortcut buttons for common locations
   - Parent directory navigation
   - Support for environment variables and ~

### View Customization

View customization options include:

1. **Hidden Files Toggle**
   - Show/hide hidden files and directories
   - Updates filter settings in file model

2. **View Modes**
   - List view (small icons)
   - Icon view (large icons)
   - Placeholder for future view modes

3. **Column Management**
   - Toggle visibility of file information columns
   - Remember active columns

## Testing

Unit tests cover:

1. **NavigationHistory**
   - Path tracking
   - Back/forward navigation
   - History limit enforcement

2. **FileExplorerWidget**
   - Initialization
   - Path setting
   - Navigation
   - Directory traversal

3. **FileExplorerPanel**
   - Initialization
   - Path setting
   - Navigation methods

## Next Steps

1. **Full View Modes**
   - Implement columns view using separate widget
   - Implement gallery view with image previews

2. **File Operations**
   - Add context menu for file operations (copy, move, delete)
   - Implement drag and drop between explorer and editor

3. **Search Integration**
   - Add search field for quick filtering
   - Implement content search

4. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for main operations
   - Implement tab completion in path editor

## Notes for Developers

- File paths are handled using Qt's QDir for cross-platform compatibility
- Navigation history is maintained within the FileExplorerWidget class
- File model caching is cleared on refresh to ensure accurate directory listing
- Tooltip shows item count for better user context
