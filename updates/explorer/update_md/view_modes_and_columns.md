# Enhanced View Modes and Columns Support

## Overview

This document details the implementation of enhanced view mode switching and column management features for the file explorer component. These enhancements provide users with more flexible ways to browse and organize files and directories.

## View Modes

### Implemented View Modes

1. **List View**
   - Compact representation with small (16x16) icons
   - Includes tree expansion arrows for navigating directories
   - Optimized for browsing deep directory structures
   - Emphasizes filename with comfortable indentation

2. **Icons View**
   - Larger icons (32x32) for better visual identification
   - Reduced indentation and no expansion arrows
   - Better for browsing directories with visual content

3. **Columns View**
   - Shows all available columns by default
   - Optimized column widths for different data types
   - No indentation for maximized horizontal space
   - Best for sorting and filtering by multiple attributes

4. **Gallery View**
   - Maximum size icons (48x48) for visual browsing
   - Only shows filename column for maximum space
   - Hides all metadata columns
   - Best for image directories or visual content

### Implementation Details

Each view mode dynamically adjusts several properties of the TreeView:

- Icon size (16px, 32px, or 48px)
- Indentation level (0px, 10px, or 20px)
- Root decoration (show/hide expand arrows)
- Column visibility and widths
- Layout spacing

The implementation preserves the current selection and focus when switching modes to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Column Management

### Available Columns

1. **Name** - File or directory name
2. **Size** - File size in appropriate units
3. **Kind** - File type or MIME type
4. **Date Modified** - Last modification timestamp
5. **Date Created** - Creation timestamp

### Column Features

1. **Toggle Visibility**
   - Individual columns can be shown or hidden
   - Appropriate to different view modes
   - Persistent column selection

2. **Column Resizing**
   - Automatic sizing based on column type
   - User resizable with mouse
   - Default widths optimized for content

3. **Column Order**
   - Name column always first
   - Other columns maintain system order

## Sorting

### Sort Features

1. **Sortable Columns**
   - Every column can be sorted by clicking its header
   - Context menu provides sort options
   - Automatic column visibility when sorting by a hidden column

2. **Sort Direction**
   - Toggle between ascending and descending order
   - Direction indicator in column header
   - Context menu selection for direction

3. **Default Sort**
   - Name column, ascending order as default
   - Persistent sort settings between sessions

### Sorting Implementation

The sorting functionality uses Qt's built-in sort capabilities with some enhancements:

- Sorting is tied to the view's header sortIndicatorChanged signal
- Automatic visibility of sorted columns
- UI integration with checkable actions
- Proper update of UI state when sort changes

## User Interface Integration

The view modes and column features are accessible through:

1. **Context Menu**
   - Right-click on path editor
   - View submenu for mode selection
   - Add Columns submenu for column visibility
   - Sort By submenu for sorting options

2. **Header Interaction**
   - Click column headers to sort
   - Right-click for column visibility options
   - Drag to resize columns
   - Drag to reorder columns

3. **Header Context Menu**
   - Right-click on the header to access view modes and column options
   - Contains all view mode options (List, Icons, Columns, Gallery)
   - Provides access to column visibility controls
   - Includes option to toggle hidden files

4. **Navigation Button Menu**
   - Accessible from the navigation button (üìÅ) in the toolbar
   - Located after a separator following the Previous/Next navigation options
   - Contains identical view mode and column options as the header context menu
   - Provides quick access to view preferences without using the header

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom View Types**
   - Consider switching to QListView for true icon view
   - Implement a custom delegate for gallery view
   - Add detail view with metadata panel

2. **Additional Columns**
   - File permissions
   - Owner/group information
   - Custom tags or metadata

3. **View Persistence**
   - Store user preferences
   - Per-directory view settings

## Summary

The enhanced view modes and column support provide users with more flexibility in how they browse and organize files. The implementation balances functionality with usability, ensuring that common tasks are easy to perform while providing depth for power users.
